servicesCTA: What can we do for your pet?
---
Pine Bark opened in 2019, as we completed construction on our brand new building. We are a small, family-owned facility, with one goal: making your pet feel at home while you are away.
Pine Bark sits on 10 beautiful acres nestled in the pines of Gratiot county. We believe that by remaining a small facility, we can provide loving one on one care for your furkids. 

Where pets are family.
