  - answer: >-
      We recommend that you bring your dog's food, to prevent them from getting
      sick from sudden changes in diet. A good leash and collar for daily walks.
    question: Should I bring anything for my dog’s stay?
  - answer: "Yes, we are happy to administer your pet's medications, free of charge."
    question: Can you provide my dog with their medications?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, we require the following vaccines for the health and safety of all
      dogs:


      * Rabies

      * Distemper

      * Parvovirus

      * Bordetella


      Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvo, and Parainfluenza might be listed as DHPP or
      DHLLPP on your dog's medical records.


      Bordetella helps prevent some strains of kennel cough. The vaccine does
      not prevent against all strains, and just like the human flu, there is a
      risk.
    question: Do you have vaccination requirements?
